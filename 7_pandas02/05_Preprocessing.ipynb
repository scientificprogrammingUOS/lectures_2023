    "## Feature selection\n",
    "First of all, why do we even bother selecting features. Doing this does not give the model more data or extra information.<br>\n",
    "And after all a good model would just select the important features and learn from them.<br>\n",
    "So assuming we have a perfect/ideal model and enough samples there would be no reason to perform feature selection.<br>\n",
    "Reading the previous sentence you are probably already thinking \"can we really assume that our model is perfect?\" and \"when do we ever have enough samples?<br>\n",
    "And so given the obvious answer to these questions we can thinking of feature selection as making the *job* of our model and thus aknowledging that its not perfect and it will not get \"enough\" samples.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now how does selecting features make the *job* of the model easier?<br>\n",
    "By removing features that are redundant or irrelveant the model does not have to first learn to not use the features and can thus converge faster and possible also to a better optimum because the model does not have to bother with what is essentially just noise. This also speeds up the training time and less ressources are used in terms of computing power and memory.<br>\n",
    "By removing the redundant/irrelevant feautes we also counteract the curse of dimensionality.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of feature selection is that the model becomes easier to interpret and the results easier to visualize.\n",
